# RealNews
A python program created to help users to find real and accurate news, and to avoid 'Fake News" sites. This program allows you to enter up to two search terms. It then retrieves links to topical searches from the major 6 U.S. News Networks. The author of the code has no affiliation with any of these networks, and is not trying to advance a particular perspective.
